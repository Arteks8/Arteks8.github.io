				In the beginning, there was a guitar... 
				My path in music started when I was 15 years old. I was never interested in playing 
				instruments before, but when I started the guitar, I could not stop. I was playing day 
				and night and learning every song I liked. I had hard times and good times, but I was still 
				playing music because I loved it. I  was playing my nice black classical guitar and even 
				performed on my prompt. However, everything changed the day after my 17th birthday...

				A day after my 17th birthday, I went to a party at my friend's house. 
				And guys brought it-electric guitar. I was super excited and played for a whole evening. 
				I worked for approximately a month that summer and bought my first electric guitar. 
				I fell in love with this instrument and started to explore the vast world of heavy music. 
				Soon, I entered university and met a lot of creative people. In my first year, my friend and I 
				performed our song at the university's talent show; I also played in different music events. 
				All that time, I was mastering my skills and learning to play the instrument.

				When my second year just started, I met my good friend who also plays guitar. We wanted to play 
				in a band but needed a drummer and bass player. After some time, the Lord sent us a fantastic bass player. 
				A drummer just appeared from nowhere, and we created a band. We debated the name: a part of the band wanted "Convergence,"
				and another: "Diseased." After a long time, we found a compromise: "Diseased Convergence" was chosen as a name. 
				We practiced and performed our song on our university show shortly and won! It was my first band performance, 
				which was a great success! I am grateful to the guys and happy to play with them. After the talent night, 
				we were jamming together a lot. Unfortunately, we will not perform on the talent show this year. 
				Still, I'm happy to play with the guys even without performing on a talent show. I feel my development, and I am going.
